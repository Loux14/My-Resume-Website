        <h2>My name is Lucas, and I'm a 2nd-year Computer Science student.</h2>
        <p>
          After 10 years as an optician, clinic manager, and optics teacher, I
          began a full-time Bachelorâ€™s Degree in Computer Science at the
          UniversitÃ© du QuÃ©bec en Outaouais, Gatineau (QC), in January 2023. I
          am now seeking my first experience in the field.
        </p>
        <h2>What you can expect from me :</h2>
        <li>
          <b>Analytical Mind:</b> I always try to find patterns, understand how
          things work, and identify similarities to exploit them.
        </li>
        <li>
          <b>Punctuality:</b> To me, being 10 minutes early is already late.
        </li>
        <li>
          <b>Consistency:</b> I like to find the best way to perform a task and
          then consistently replicate it.
        </li>
        <li>
          <b>Open-Mindedness:</b> I enjoy interacting with others and learning
          from different perspectives. I easily accept when Iâ€™m wrong.
        </li>
        <li>
          <b>Passionate:</b> I chose computer science because I can spend my
          week in front of a screen solving problems without counting the hours.
        </li>
        <li>
          <b>Competitiveness:</b> I thrive on challenges and participate in
          every university competition I can. Iâ€™m not afraid of short deadlines.
        </li>
        <li>
          <b>Team Spirit:</b> I believe that working with great colleagues and
          enjoying quality time with teammates can make the difference between a
          simple job and a great working experience.
